# WinFormGame
Proof of concept for a windows forms based video game for a code-a-thon
The goal was to get students to better understand and use objects, and develop their own skills planning out and executing a project
from start to finish
#TODO
Error testing
Streamline starting a new game - move from one form to another
Balance the game a wee bit better
